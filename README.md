## Description

Given a dataset of user utterances, how do we determine intents, or classifications, we should train a chatbot on? We could manually label the utterances one-by-one with their respective intent, but that could take too much time. We could filter the utterances by keywords, but different words may mean the same thing â€“ or the same words may mean different things. We could deploy intents iteratively, but we would have a high chance of mistaking untrained utterances as trained ones. This project explores a solution; cluster the entire dataset of user utterances based on their similarity and use the resulting clusters as the intents in the bot.
